# Reinforcement-Learning-Specialization
Assignments from the Coursera Reinforcement Learning Specialisation offered by the the University of Alberta, completed May 18th 2021
Two assignment are in .ipynb format because of Coursera's site limitations, i.e. internal server errors whenever a .pdf was requested.
I had to copy and paste these, and formatting the comments wasn't great, so I have only included the active code blocks. Every other
assignment is available in .pdf format.
